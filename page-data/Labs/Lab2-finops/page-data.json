Turbonomic dynamically synthesizes a set of useful executive dashboards that help the bank better focus their cost optimization efforts. Doing this manually and continuously would be unscalable and inefficient.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of these dashboards.\n\n1.

Taking the recommended actions can result in a large potential savings ($3500/month in the case of this demo, but it could easily be substantially more). After data populates for an extended period of time, additional fields (Such as 30-day cost) will be populated for additional reference on savings. A consistent percentage of monthly savings (such as 10% of 30-day cost) can lead to massive savings for a large-scale cloud environment.\n\n## Receive recommendations for potential savings opportunities\n\n2. In the Potential Savings dashboard, point out the total monthly potential savings (inside the donut chart) and the breakdown list.\n\n<InlineNotification>\nThe numbers may be small in this case, as this is a demo environment.

In the breakdown list on the right, we see that the bulk of these savings can be realized by righsizing/scaling virtual machines.
