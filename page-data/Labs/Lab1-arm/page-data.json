The three tabs at the top give you access to global (full-environment) views.\n2. The Supply Chain on the left shows you the entities Turbonomic has discovered and their health.\n3. The pending actions show you the actions you should take to optimize your environment and ensure performance.\n4. These are Widgets. They are panels that contain information regarding your environment.\n5. On the far left is the Navigator – you can use this to access Turbonomic’s other features.\n\n![dashboard](img/explore/dashboard.png)\n\nClick on \"On-Prem\" from the tabs above to view the health of your entire on-prem environment.\n\n![onprem](img/explore/onprem.png)\n\nNow click on the \"Cloud\" tab to narrow the focus on all cloud environments monitored. Since cloud instances usually have dollar values associated with them, Turbonomic can provide you with a detailed report of the necessary investments you need to make to ensure performance and the total cost savings resulting from taking all actions. Remember, the total dollar amount is IF you take ALL actions generated by Turbonomic for the cloud instances. As you can see in the example below, the cost savings is significant compared to the necessary investments. And this is while assuring application performance.\n\nClick on \"Show All\" under both \"Necessary Investments\" and \"Potential Savings\" to explore actions regarding each.\n\n![cloud](img/explore/cloud.png)\n\n## Supply chain\n\nLet's take a closer look at the Supply Chain. From the three tabs above, click on \"Applications\" to go back to the main dashboard.\nBusiness applications are comprised of multiple components running on many different infrastructures. Each circle in the supply chain represents an entity. Each entity has a name and number and is surrounded by a circle of colors. Green equals the desired state, Yellow represents efficiency actions, Red shows that the resources are congested. See the example below. \n\n![sc1](img/explore/sc1.png)\n\nThe direction of the arrows is also meaningful. They show the direction of the purchase of resources. Turbonomic sees the resources available as a marketplace. Every entity can sell resources or buy them. For example, a VM buys resources from the host it resides on, then sells them to the application components running on it. In this scenario, a VM is a consumer of resources (from the physical host) and a supplier of resources (for the application components). See the image below.\n\n![buysell](img/explore/buysell.png)\n\nclick on the Host entity in the supply chain. This will open up a page with information regarding all your hosts, policies applied to them, and a list of actions for them. Explore each tab. \nThe pending actions section shows you the actions that Turbonomic recommends that you tackle to assure performance, save cost, etc. Once you add it as a target, it analyses your environment and starts providing the actions.\n\n![host1](img/explore/host1.png)\n\n## Navigator\n\nThe Navigator will provide you with quick access to different parts of Turbonomic. This toolbar will remain constant as you explore different parts of the environment. \n\n![nav1](img/explore/nav1.png)\n\n1. The \"ON\" Button will always bring you back to the main dashboard view.\n2. Use the \"Search\" page to find the entities you are looking for.\n3. The planning page in Turbonomic is used to run simulations for what-if scenarios that will help you gain insight into the results of specific changes before making them. A plan has no impact on real-time environments.\n4. From the Workload Placement Page, you can set up reservations to save the resources you will need to deploy VMs at a future date. Turbonomic calculates optimal placement for these VMs and then reserves the host and storage resources that they need.\n5. The dashboard tab will allow you to create custom dashboards to fit your needs.\n6. The reports tab will allow you to generate different reports of your environment and resources.\n7. The Settings page includes links related to Policies, License, User Management, Targets, etc.\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d07a4e978583ee63902a69383f4c5662","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":2313},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab1-arm"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab1-arm\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    ARM 1 - Global view of the applications and their infrastructure dependencies <br />\n  </span>\n)\n;\n\n## Main Dashboard\n\n\nUpon login, you will be presented with the main Turbonomic dashboard.  \n1.
