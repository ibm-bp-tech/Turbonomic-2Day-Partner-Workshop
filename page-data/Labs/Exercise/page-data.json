Create a static group named \"qotd\" for Quote of the day business application.\n2. Create a Business application automation policy named \"qotd\" for the newly created group. \n3. Enable response time SLO for response time > 100ms (You may adjust the response time based on the actual response time of the Qotd business application in your environment) and save the policy.\n4. Observe the impact of the policy after some time, if business application response time is greater than specified SLO, you should see SLO voilation in the Turbo UI. \n\n## Exercise 2\n    \n1.

Automation policy should be for action type \"VCPU Limit resize up\" and recommend only to avoid manual/automatic action execution.\n4.
