Turbonomic uses targets to monitor workload and execute actions in your environment. Turbonomic communicates with the target via the management protocol it exposes — The REST API, SMI-S, XML, or some other management transport. Turbonomic uses this communication to discover the managed entities, monitor resource utilization, and execute actions.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** Turbonomic must be on a network with access to the specific services you want to set up as targets. (but we have this part covered for this session)\r\n\r\n\r\n## [1]. Adding Instana Target\r\n\r\nTurbonomic supports the discovery of applications managed by APM tools - in this case, the Instana platform. Turbonomic includes the discovered information about these applications in its calculations for environmental health.\r\n\r\nWe have already prepared an Instana server for your environment. This server is monitoring two applications: RobotShop and Quote of the Day. In this section, you will go through the steps to add this Instana instance to your Turbonomic environment.\r\n\r\n### Generate Instana API Token\r\n\r\n1. To connect Instana to Turbonomic, you will need an API token from your Instana server so that Turbonomic can authenticate the connection. To generate this key navigate to your bastion VM and click on the Instana tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. This will take you to the Instana login page. Log in using your Instana credentials. Instana credentials are provided in Turbo-PoT-Credentials tab.\r\n\r\n![instanatab](img/addtargets/instanatab.png)\r\n\r\n3. Once you log in, click the gear icon on the left menu to open settings.\r\n\r\n![instana2](img/addtargets/instana2.png)\r\n\r\n4. In the settings page, under \"Team Settings\", click on \"API Tokens\". Then click on \"Add New Token\".\r\n\r\n![instana3](img/addtargets/instana3.png)\r\n\r\n5. Give your token a unique name like \"api_YourInitials\". Then scroll down and click on \"Save\". You can leave all other settings as default.\r\n![instana4](img/addtargets/instana4.png)\r\n![instana5](img/addtargets/instana5.png)\r\n\r\n6. Now click on the eye icon to reveal your API token and take note of it. You will need this key in the next section. \r\n![instana6](img/addtargets/instana6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add Instana as a target\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your Turbonomic console on the bastion VM, then click \"Settings\" from the navigator.\r\n\r\n![turbo-main](img/addtargets/turbo-main.png)\r\n\r\n2. Select the \"Target Configuration\" option. This will open up the page containing all configured targets.\r\n\r\n![target-settings](img/addtargets/target-settings.png)\r\n\r\n3.  Click \"New Target\". This will open up a page with a list of available target types for this environment. \r\n\r\n**Tip:** This is not an extensive list of available target types. To view the full list and supported versions, visit the [documentation site](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tarm/8.8.0?topic=overview-turbonomic-targets).\r\n\r\n![target-page](img/addtargets/target-page.png)\r\n\r\n4. From the list, select \"Applications and Databases\". Then select \"Instana\".\r\n\r\n![add-instana-1](img/addtargets/add-instana-1.png)\r\n\r\n![add-instana-2](img/addtargets/add-instana-2.png) \r\n\r\n5. To add Instana, all you need is the hostname or IP address of your Instana server and an API token generated from your Instana backend. Once you have filled out this information, click \"Add\" at the bottom of the page. Since we don't have a proxy, we can leave those parts empty.\r\n\r\n**Note**:** If the hostname and/or IP address is pre-populated as administrator and a password in this step, clear both and type in your information. \r\n\r\n**Tip:** Keep in mind, the hostname or IP address must be visible to Turbonomic. If you have your Instana and Turbonomic instances installed in different networks or the communication between them is blocked by a firewall, the target configuration will fail. \r\n\r\n![add-instana-3](img/addtargets/add-instana-3.png)\r\n\r\n6. Your newly added Instana target will appear in your list of targets. Check the \"status\" and \"severity\", it must show as \"Validated\" and \"Normal\". Congratulations, you have successfully connected your Instana environment to Turbonomic.\r\n\r\n![validated](img/addtargets/validated.png)\r\n\r\nNow that you have added a new target, allow 15 minutes for Turbonomic to run discovery and add the data from Instana. To check this, look at your top business applications and look for two applications that will be added in from Instana: Quote of the Day, and RobotShop.\r\n\r\n![listapps](img/addtargets/listapps.png)\r\n\r\n![apps](img/addtargets/apps.png)\r\n\r\n## [2]. Adding Kubernetes Target\r\n\r\nThe Turbonomic platform gathers information from Kubernetes/OpenShift environment through **Kubeturbo** that is deployed into the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster that you want to manage. Kubeturbo will run a single pod deployment with the following resources:\r\n\r\n- Namespace or Project (default: turbo)\r\n- Service Account\r\n- Rolebinding defined\r\n- ConfigMap which contains the connection to the Turbonomic server\r\n- Deployment for Kubeturbo pod.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information is available on the [Kubeturbo Wiki](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/wiki). In this tutorial, you will be installing Kubeturbo via helm chart.\r\n\r\n### Kubeturbo deployment via Helm charts\r\n\r\nAs per the requirements, for the KubeTurbo to communicate with the Turbonomic server, you need\r\n* Turbonomic URL: https://10.0.0.1\r\n* ServiceAccount: kubeserviceaccount (you will create this as described below)\r\n\r\n### Create Service Account\r\n\r\nThe various steps to create a service account are:\r\n\r\n- From your Turbonomic UI navigate to Settings -> User Management \r\n\r\n  ![user_mgmt](img/addtargets/usermgmt.png)\r\n\r\n- Select **NEW LOCAL USER**  \r\n  ![lu](img/addtargets/newlu1.png)\r\n\r\n- For the user details, please fill as\r\n  - **USERNAME**: kubeserviceaccount\r\n  - **PASSWORD**: Refer to \"Turbo-PoT-Credentials\" on you bastion VM\r\n  - **ROLE**: Site Administrator (default)\r\n  - and then click **SAVE**  \r\n  ![newuser](img/addtargets/userdetails.png)\r\n\r\n- Validate the user is created  \r\n  ![usercr](img/addtargets/usercreated.png)\r\n\r\n### Install Kubeturbo on the Kubernetes cluster\r\n\r\nThe Kubeturbo is installed on the provided Kubernetes cluster. In this section, you will SSH into your Kubernetes cluster from your bastion VM. **So all commands will be executed from your bastion VM's Terminal window.**\r\n\r\n- Find the Turbonomic Server Version from the console: The version here is **8.8.2**, as shown in the picture.  \r\n  \r\n  ![turbo_version](img/addtargets/turbosrv_version.png)\r\n\r\n- Open a Terminal window in your bastion VM. Navigate to \"Activities\" from the top left and click on Terminal.\r\n\r\n- SSH to server kmaster (IPAddress: 10.0.0.3) using **user-id: cocuser**, **password: Refer to \"Turbo-PoT-Credentials\" on you bastion VM** and **ssh port: 2022**\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  ssh -p 2022 cocuser@10.0.0.3\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  To list all the helm releases in the cluster, execute the command below.\r\n  ```\r\n  helm ls -A \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  For example: to view the release for the Instana agent only, run this command\r\n  ```\r\n  helm ls -n instana-agent\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result will be something like this:\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n   NAME          NAMESPACE    \tREVISION\tUPDATED                                \tSTATUS  \tCHART               \tAPP VERSION\r\n   instana-agent instana-agent\t1       \t2023-03-20 23:33:01.070041691 -0400 EDT\tdeployed\tinstana-agent-1.2.56\t1.244.0\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n- [Kubeturbo git](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo.git) is cloned locally. Then follow the steps:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd kubeturbo/deploy\r\n  kubectl create ns turbo\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result should be like this:\r\n  ```\r\n  namespace/turbo created\r\n  cocuser@kmaster:~/kubeturbo/deploy$ \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Next run the following install command to install kubeturbo:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  helm install  kubeturbo  ./kubeturbo --namespace turbo \\\r\n       --set serverMeta.turboServer=https://10.0.0.1 \\\r\n       --set serverMeta.version=8.8.2 --set image.tag=8.8.2 \\\r\n       --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerUserName=kubeserviceaccount \\\r\n       --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerPassword='CoC#Rulz!' \\\r\n       --set targetConfig.targetName=kubecluster1\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Will give output as:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  NAME: kubeturbo\r\n  LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar 30 20:34:33 2023\r\n  NAMESPACE: turbo\r\n  STATUS: deployed\r\n  REVISION: 1\r\n  TEST SUITE: None\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n**Tip**: The following commands may be handy, in case you run into issues and need to troubleshoot.  Do not use the below helm commands unless your helm install failed.  See the next set of kubectl commands for installation validation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# To remove helm release\r\nhelm delete <release name> -n <namespace>\r\n\r\nFor ex: helm delete kubeturbo -n turbo (To delete kubeturbo)\r\n\r\n# To upgrade an existing release\r\nhelm upgrade <release name> -n <namespace> <other options>\r\n\r\nFor example: (** Don't forget to change the password in the command **)\r\nhelm upgrade  kubeturbo  ./kubeturbo --namespace turbo \\\r\n    --set serverMeta.turboServer=https://10.0.0.1 \\\r\n    --set serverMeta.version=8.8.2 --set image.tag=8.8.2 \\\r\n    --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerUserName=kubeserviceaccount \\\r\n    --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerPassword=myPassw0rd \\\r\n    --set targetConfig.targetName=kubecluster1\r\n\r\n# To set the context for a namespace\r\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>\r\n\r\nFor ex: (to set the context to turbo namespace)\r\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace=turbo\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the logs to see if kubeturbo communicates with the Turbonomic Server.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  kubectl -n turbo get pods \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result will be like following:\r\n  ```\r\n  output\r\n  ------\r\n  NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\r\n  kubeturbo-5fb9df466d-l7lk4   1/1     Running   0          5m47s\r\n  ```\r\n  To check the logs for this pod take your pod's name from the output of the previous command and run the command below using your pod name.\r\n  ```\r\n  kubectl -n turbo logs -f kubeturbo-5fb9df466d-l7lk4\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result will be a loop that keeps printing the logs for that pod, similar to the snippet below:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  snippet of output\r\n  -----------------\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398686       1 kubeturbo_builder.go:519] ********** Start running Kubeturbo Service **********\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398736       1 mediation_container.go:67] Initializing mediation container .....\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398740       1 mediation_container.go:74] Registering 1 probes\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398769       1 client_websocket_transport.go:381] Trying websocket connection to: wss://10.0.0.1/vmturbo/remoteMediation\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407740       1 client_websocket_transport.go:384] Successfully connected to api service at: wss://10.0.0.1/vmturbo/remoteMediation\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407779       1 client_websocket_transport.go:305] Connected to server 10.0.0.1:443::192.168.1.219:40362\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407785       1 client_websocket_transport.go:306] WebSocket transport layer is ready.\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407799       1 remote_mediation_client.go:92] Start sdk client protocol ........\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407814       1 sdk_client_protocol.go:35] Starting protocol negotiation ....\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.411017       1 sdk_client_protocol.go:118] Protocol negotiation result: ACCEPTED.

See the next set of kubectl commands for installation validation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# To remove helm release\r\nhelm delete <release name> -n <namespace>\r\n\r\nFor ex: helm delete kubeturbo -n turbo (To delete kubeturbo)\r\n\r\n# To upgrade an existing release\r\nhelm upgrade <release name> -n <namespace> <other options>\r\n\r\nFor example: (** Don't forget to change the password in the command **)\r\nhelm upgrade  kubeturbo  ./kubeturbo --namespace turbo \\\r\n    --set serverMeta.turboServer=https://10.0.0.1 \\\r\n    --set serverMeta.version=8.8.2 --set image.tag=8.8.2 \\\r\n    --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerUserName=kubeserviceaccount \\\r\n    --set restAPIConfig.opsManagerPassword=myPassw0rd \\\r\n    --set targetConfig.targetName=kubecluster1\r\n\r\n# To set the context for a namespace\r\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>\r\n\r\nFor ex: (to set the context to turbo namespace)\r\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace=turbo\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the logs to see if kubeturbo communicates with the Turbonomic Server.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  kubectl -n turbo get pods \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result will be like following:\r\n  ```\r\n  output\r\n  ------\r\n  NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\r\n  kubeturbo-5fb9df466d-l7lk4   1/1     Running   0          5m47s\r\n  ```\r\n  To check the logs for this pod take your pod's name from the output of the previous command and run the command below using your pod name.\r\n  ```\r\n  kubectl -n turbo logs -f kubeturbo-5fb9df466d-l7lk4\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The result will be a loop that keeps printing the logs for that pod, similar to the snippet below:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  snippet of output\r\n  -----------------\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398686       1 kubeturbo_builder.go:519] ********** Start running Kubeturbo Service **********\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398736       1 mediation_container.go:67] Initializing mediation container .....\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398740       1 mediation_container.go:74] Registering 1 probes\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.398769       1 client_websocket_transport.go:381] Trying websocket connection to: wss://10.0.0.1/vmturbo/remoteMediation\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407740       1 client_websocket_transport.go:384] Successfully connected to api service at: wss://10.0.0.1/vmturbo/remoteMediation\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407779       1 client_websocket_transport.go:305] Connected to server 10.0.0.1:443::192.168.1.219:40362\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407785       1 client_websocket_transport.go:306] WebSocket transport layer is ready.\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407799       1 remote_mediation_client.go:92] Start sdk client protocol ........\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.407814       1 sdk_client_protocol.go:35] Starting protocol negotiation ....\r\n  I0331 14:35:10.411017       1 sdk_client_protocol.go:118] Protocol negotiation result: ACCEPTED.
