Turbonomic observes and tracks CPU throttling. In the case of Quote of the Day, the response time latency of the quote service can severely impact the delivery of a quote.\nGiven the rate of throttling being observed, Turbonomic recommends increasing the CPU limit from 150 mCores to 250 mCores. Proactively alleviating CPU congestion pressures by providing these analytics-driven recommendations helps keep the application in the desired state where it meets its defined service-level objectives (SLOs).\n\n3.
